### Gradient_descent algo that minimizes a function over given set of parameters
	- iterative minimization. 

### goal of linear regression is to fit line to set of data points
	- best way to achieve this is to define an error function or cost function = measures how good a given line is.. error term to line on fit.
	- iterate over data (x,y) and sum the square distances btwn points (y, exp_y) exp_y is linear interpolation of y based on x.
	- distance is squared.. workable in programming..
	- lines that fit better based on our data minimize the error function

### Gradient_descent attempts to find the lowest point of (b, m) error terms or cost function
	- error term should degrade over each iteration.
	- convergence when ROC on error term gets minimized

	
### R^2 = 1- ratio of residual variability. 
	- variability of residual values vs. regression line
	- R-square of 0.6 the variability around regression line = 1-.60 or 0.40 residual variability or not explained variability...
	- how well the model fits the data.
	** model objective for r^2
	- R^2 as describing the relationship between predictors and response variable 
	- OR R^2 as predicting the response variable
	
### R is the correlation coefficient, if B coefficient is positive then relationship to dependant variable is positive.
